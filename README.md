###### Literate programming
This project attemps to make programs more literate. In a sense, it is a manifestation of literate programming. However, it doesn't follow the common idioms of literate programming such as chunks, tangles, WEB and CWEB, and so on. I'd love to dive more into that at some point. If you're interested, you might check out [Ask HN: Why did literate programming not catch on?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10069748) and tools like [Show HN: Lit â€“ a modern literate programming tool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8184909). There's also [1.0 Literate Programming - A Gentle Introduction](http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html) which I had a bit of trouble following, and the top blog post [Literate programming: Knuth is doing it wrong
](http://akkartik.name/post/literate-programming).
